# Data Structures and Algorithms Using Java Documentation

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Using Java Documentation repository! This repository contains documentation, explanations, and implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java.

## Introduction

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding fundamental data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science and software development. Whether you're a beginner learning the basics or an experienced programmer looking for a quick reference, you'll find useful information here.

## Bubble Sort

[Bubble Sort](/BubbleSort.java) is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Merge Sort

[Merge Sort](/MergeSort.java) is a sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts the subarrays, and then merges them. It's efficient for large datasets and has a stable O(n log n) time complexity.

## Quick Sort

[Quick Sort](/QuickSort.java) is a sorting algorithm that divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them independently, and then combines them. It has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n) and is widely used due to its efficiency.
